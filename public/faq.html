We have emulated the brains of human cyber security experts into our technology, thus it has the logic & thinking of a human expert’s brain & acts as if cyber security experts themselves are analysing & protecting the computer. This combination of human logic and the computational power of the computer provides fortified protection against all types of viruses without the need for any updates. Moreover the experience of ethical hackers & virus researchers helps us to pre-empt cyber-criminals techniques & catch them.</p>

These signature files range in size from 100 MB to about 250MB. The average cost of internet data is around $ 0.26. per GB.(approx. 1,000 MB = 1 GB).

Though the resources utilised depends on the number & kind of applications running on the computer, however generally the memory utilisation ranges between 40 – 90 MB & CPU utilisation fluctuates between 0 – 15%. Due to this Matisoft antivirus can run smoothly on very old computers also, having around 500 MB of memory.</p>

                            <p><strong>• Viruses:</strong> Like their biological namesakes, viruses attach themselves to clean files and infect other clean files. They can spread uncontrollably, damaging a system’s core functionality and deleting or corrupting files.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>•	Worms:</strong> Worms infect entire networks of devices, either local or across the internet, by using network interfaces. It uses each consecutive infected machine to infect more.</p>
                            <p><strong>•	Trojans:</strong> This kind of malware disguises itself as legitimate software, or is included in legitimate software that has been tampered with. It tends to act discretely and create backdoors in the security system to allow entry to other malware.</p>
                            <p><strong>•	Ransomware:</strong> Also called scareware, this kind of malware can lock down your computer and threaten to erase/encrypt everything — unless a ransom is paid to its owner.</p>
                            <p><strong>•	Spyware: </strong>Spyware is a malware designed to spy on you. It hides in the background and takes notes on what you do online, including your passwords, credit card numbers, surfing habits and more.</p>
                            <p><strong>•	Adware:</strong> These are not always malicious in nature, but some aggressive advertising software can undermine the security system just to show advertisements — which can give a lot of other malware a way in. Plus pop-ups themselves are very annoying.</p>
                            <p><strong>•	Botnets:</strong> Botnets are networks of infected computers that are made to work together under the control of an attacker.</p>

                            <p>Heuristics is an approximation method that tries to find the closest possible answer to a definite answer. Heuristic scanners work by detecting virus-like characteristics or virus-like behaviour. This method is mostly used to detect new malware by examining files for suspicious characteristics that may hint towards a malware. For instance, an antivirus tool might look for the presence of rare instructions or junk code in the examined file. The tool might also emulate running the file, to flag off any suspected behaviour. The biggest problem of heuristics is the high rate of false positives which means that it can inadvertently flag legitimate files as malicious.</p>

                        <div  class="toggle-content">
                            <p>In signature/dictionary based detection method, an antivirus manages a data/dictionary file which is filled with virus signatures.Whenever a new virus is discovered by an antivirus company it is analysed by their employees(who are called virus researchers) to find a unique line(i.e. a virus signature) with which the file can be uniquely identified. Once this virus signature is identified, then this is updated on to the company’s servers. Now this new signature has to be downloaded by the client/your computer to include this new virus signature into your antivirus database. After this new signature is updated on your antivirus, your antivirus can catch this new virus by checking for this new line/virus signature in the files on your computer.</p>
                            <p>This method of detecting virus has been an essential aspect of antivirus tools since their inception & it remains an important part of most tools to date. A major limitation of the method is that, by itself, it is unable to flag malicious files for which signatures have not yet been developed. With this in mind, modern attackers frequently mutate their creations to retain malicious functionality by changing the file’s signature</p>

                            <p >A virus signature may be thought of as alphabets that are unique to a specific file. E.g. A file containing the line “I am a virus & I will infect your computer” can be selected as a unique line to identify this particular file from thousands of files. Thus this line becomes distinguishing factor(signature) to identify this file out of thousands of files.</p>

                        <div class="toggle-content">
                            <p>There are 2 techniques used by antivirus software to scan & catch viruses, which are on-access scan & on-demand scan.</p>
                            <p><strong>On-access</strong>  scanning/Real time scanning: In this technique the antivirus software runs in the background  & automatically checks all the files/apps that you open on your computer. It gives real time protection as all files/apps are checked just after they are clicked & before they are opened. This scanning technique has the advantage of catching the virus before it is opened & causes any harm to the computer/device. Moreover it relieves the user of any manual/On-Demand scans. Matisoft uses real time scanning.</p>
                            <p><strong>On-Demand</strong> scanning: This antivirus technique scans the files on your computer hard drive for viruses only when prompted to do so by the computer user, or by scheduling it as a time-specific task(& thus it got the name “On-demand scanners”). Though this technique may discover dormant viruses on the hard disk(which may also be caught when they are opened by the computer user using On-access scanning), but due to the resources & time utilized by this technique it is becoming less popular with antivirus software.</p>

                            <p>All antivirus software that use signature/dictionary based virus detection technique needs to be updated regularly to catch new viruses because this is the basic requirement of this technology to work.

                            <p>Generally all antivirus software are updated at least daily to catch new viruses. However there is no fixed rule, every company has its own policies, some companies update only once a day to keep the data usage of the customer minimum & at the same time lower the burden on their servers. Other companies might choose to send updates every 6-8 hours. This will increase internet usage of the consumer but at the same time the antivirus will be prepared sooner to catch brand new viruses.</p>

These are normally compressed for download & also digitally signed for security reasons.The size of the file depends on various factors like structure of the definition file, the number of signatures in the file, the antivirus company’s policy if it wants to catch more number of viruses on the user’s computer(which means bigger virus definition files) versus the company wants their antivirus to use less resources & be more light on the client’s computer(which means smaller virus definition files)</p>
